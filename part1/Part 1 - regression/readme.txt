It is recommended to use google colab for running this, some of the algorithms take 20 minutes in terminal!

Load to google colab -> Pipeline-Tensor-Flow.ipynb -> select 'diamonds.csv' as file -> Run (Make sure TPU in runtime in enabled).


In terminal -> python3 Pipeline-Jupyter-Notebook.py
Or if you want an output file -> python3 Pipeline-Jupyter-Notebook.py > output.txt
