Run the jupyter notebook through terminal using the execution command: 
        -> cd into jupyter-notebook-pipelines -> run -> classification-pipeline-jupyter-notebook.py > output.txt'

Google colab file reading has been setup different and uses the google-drive.
Again I would recommend using google-colab as it's significantly faster on the google TPU.
These files are located in the google-colab-pipelines folder.
